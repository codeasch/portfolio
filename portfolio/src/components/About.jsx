      <p>
        Hello! I'm Andrew Schulman, a senior at Vernon Hills High School with a strong passion 
        for computer science and game development. I have completed courses in AP CS Principles, 
        AP CS A, iOS App Development, and I am currently enrolled in Advanced Topics in Computer Science. 
        In my spare time, I run YapMaps, a business that develops video games in Unreal Engine, 
        with a reach of over 15 million players worldwide!
